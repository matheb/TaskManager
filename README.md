# [TaskManager]( https://matheb.github.io/TaskManager/)

It is a simple full-stack application, hosted on GithubPages(frontend),  Glitch(backend) and freesqldatabase.com(database).
This is a project for a 24 hour long hackaton, for trying out and testing in use frameworks like AngularJS and SemanticUI (CSS).
The aim was to challenge ourselves and produce a working, full-stack app in such a short time, and in the meanwhile discover technologies which are absolutely new for us.

IMPORTANT:
We didn't really have time to think about security aspects, so if you want to try it, please use dummy user and password!
